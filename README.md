# About-Me
Hi, I'm Anthony!
I'm a passionate programmer with experience in Python, C++, C,  love building projects that solve real-world problems. As a kid I always loved hoe games were made and coded, thats why I developed games like Tic-Tac-Toe to creating practical tools like a Student Grade Management System, I enjoy turning ideas into functional applications.
My passion for computer science stems from its endless possibilities to create, innovate, and solve problems. I'm fascinated by how code transform abstract ideas into tangible solutions, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies to expand my skill set.
I aim to apply my knowledge of programming and problem-solving to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with like-minded developers, and make a positive impact through new areas like machine learning, I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a developer.
